# Developing Murine Cerebellum scRNA Analysis

The goal of this project is to explore the trajectory of early Neural Progenitor Cell (NPC) lineages in the developing murine cerebellum. Brain tissue samples were collected from 12 critical developmental timepoints randing from embryonic day E10 to postnatal day P10. The scRNA-seq data was retrieved from the GEO Accession Viewer (GEO Accession GSE224466). 

# Hypothesis 

Cerebellar NPCs arising at mouse embryonic days E10.5-11.5 remain plastic for stochastic fate switching between Atoh1⁺ uRL progenitors and Ptf1a⁺ VZ progenitors. Additionally, Bergmann glia (BG) initially overlap with GABAergic progenitors in the VZ between E13-E14 but activate gliogenesis genes to establish a distinct non-neuronal trajectory.

# Methodology

The data was analyzed in Rstudio using Seurat and Monocle3. The workflow has been outlined below:

# Developing Murine Cerebellum scRNA Analysis

This project aims to explore the trajectory of early Neural Progenitor Cell linefes in the developing murine cerebellum. Samples were retrieved from 12 critical developmental timepoints from embronic day E10 to postnatal day P10. The data was retrieved from the NCBIs GEO Accession Viewer (GEO Accession GSE224466). 

# Hypothesis 

Cerebellar NPCs arising at mouse embryonic days E10.5-11.5 remain plastic for stochastic fate switching between Atoh1⁺ uRL progenitors and Ptf1a⁺ VZ progenitors. Additionally, Bergmann glia (BG) initially overlap with GABAergic progenitors in the VZ between E13-E14 but activate gliogenesis genes to establish a distinct non-neuronal trajectory.

# Methodology

Samples were analyzed in Rstudio using Seurat and Monocle3.
